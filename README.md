l2perf
------

l2perf is a networking tool for Linux that aims to be similar to iperf UDP mode
but for layer 2 (data link) networking. It utilizes the pnet library for data
link layer communication to generate and receive traffic.

### Use Cases

Although it doesn't sound very useful, it may come in handy if you just need to
generate some random traffic over a network to create a test case you need.
As long as there is a valid MAC destination address on the receiving end it
shouldn't require any prior connection or IP layer setup just to generate
traffic. There may be valid cases without an existing destination MAC address
but for most cases packets will likely get dropped on the other end of the
link.

If you run the tool also on the receiving end, it can be used to analyze
achievable bandwidth and drop rates in a similar way to iperf UDP.

### Usage

The tool allows you to configure the network interface, payload size,
ethertype, test duration and the target bandwidth. See `--help` for additional
info.

### Example Run

An example test output from a test with a laptop using Intel 802.11ac WiFi card
to a receiving Raspberry Pi 4 connected to a WiFi router over Ethernet.
